**How to test the finalized prompt structures:**

1. **Open OpenAI Playground:** https://platform.openai.com/playground
2. **Copy one of the personalized prompts** from `final_prompt_structures_week2.md`.
3. **Paste it in the Playground input box.**
4. Set:
   - Model: GPT-4 or GPT-4o
   - Temperature: 0.7 (for slight creativity)
   - Max Tokens: 200–300 (enough for a short feedback paragraph)
5. Click **Submit** — check if the output matches your required tone and structure.
6. Tweak wording if needed to refine clarity or positivity.

✅ **Tip:** Test a few prompts with different rubric scores to see how well the model handles varied strengths and weaknesses.

You can save the best Playground runs as examples for your project documentation.
